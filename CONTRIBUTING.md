## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Edit files in the `src/` directory
   - The example app will automatically reflect your changes

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run typecheck
   npm run lint
   ```

4. **Build the library**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Code Standards

- **TypeScript**: All code must be written in TypeScript with proper types
- **ESLint**: Follow the existing ESLint configuration
- **Reanimated**: Use worklets for performance-critical code
- **Comments**: Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- **Tests**: Write tests for new functionality

### Animation System Guidelines

This library uses a sophisticated state-based animation system. When contributing:

1. **Respect the state machine**: `gesture` â†’ `spring` â†’ `static`
2. **Use worklets**: Mark functions that run on UI thread with `'worklet'`
3. **Avoid conflicts**: Only one system should control animations at a time
4. **Performance first**: Prefer UI thread execution for gesture handling

### Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

For watch mode during development:
```bash
npm test -- --watch
```

### Example App

The example app is crucial for testing changes:
```bash
# iOS
npm run example:ios

# Android  
npm run example:android

# Web
npm run example:web
```
